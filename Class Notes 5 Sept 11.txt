Python Tokens:
==============
Token is a piece of python code which can be a
1.Keyword
2.Identifier
3.Literal
4.Variable
5.Constants
6.Datatype
7.Operators
8.Control Statements
___________________________________________________________________

1.Literal	:A literal is a value which is stored into register
2.Identifier	:An Identifier is a name which is given to the register
3.Variable	:A variable is a register which value can be varies
4.Constant	:A constant is a register which value cannot be varies
=========================================================================
Identifier:
___________
	An Identifier is a name which is given to the register.
	A register can be a 
		variable
		constant
		function
		class
		object
		..
	To delcare an Identifier their exist some rules 

Rule1:	An identifier must prepared by using following character set combination only
	1.Alphabets		(a,z,A,Z)
	2.Digits		(0-9)
	3.Special Character	(_)

Rule2: An identifier must not be a only digit
			
	
3.Variable:
===========
	A variable is a register which value can be varies
syntax:
	variablename=value

Note:
_____
1.C,Cpp,Java,C#.Net languages are statically typed programming languages: 
	Step1: declare type of variable
		int	x;
		float	y;
	Step2: assign value to a variable based on type	
		x=25;	
		y=3.6F;
2.Python language is a dynamically typed programming language:
	Step1:Assign a value to variable
	Step2:Based on value which is assigned the type is decided
Ex:	
	x=25
	type(x)		#int
	x=6.3
	type(x)		#float
	x='Chanti'
	type(x)		#str
	x=True
	type(x)		#bool
